1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'

Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
have?');
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
== for now)
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
is greater than 1
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
is this happening?
7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
when you input 1
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
situation

country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
island.
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
Canada :D)
